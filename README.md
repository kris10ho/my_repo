I remember being in eighth grade and my English teacher required the class to annotate the novel we were going through as one of our assignments. As a perfectionist, I remember feeling overwhelmed and unsure about where to start. I wanted to make sure I was doing everything right, whether that was highlighting the right quotes or writing the most genius insight about a certain passage. But the whole process ended up being so stressful that I didn’t return to annotating my books until I entered college. 

## Why Annotate?

- **Remember your reading better** by taking notes or flagging favorite sections as you read.
- **Make the most of your reading experience** by actively engaging with the text rather than just skimming through.
- **Have something to look back on** to relive your first reading experience with a book and track your growth as a reader.

## What Should I Annotate?

Annotating is all about personal preference. There is no one “right” way to annotate. But if you are a beginner, here are some tips and recommended supplies to help you get started. 

### Write Something that Stood Out to You

One of the advantages of annotating is actively engaging with a text and tracking your thought process. Even if it is for a silly reason, it helps to write on your post-it why you wanted to mark that passage instead of simply just sticking it on the page. For example, I recently reread Pride and Prejudice and when the Gardiners make their first appearance in the novel, I wrote on my marker, “Finally! A suitable match!” Even something as simple as that helps my future self recall why that particular passage stood out to me in the first place. 

## How to Annotate Your Books 

### Use Post-It Page Markers

If you are afraid of writing in your books, consider writing on post-its instead. These [post-it page markers](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Markers-Assorted-Fluorescent-670-5AF/dp/B00006JNML) are perfect for making small annotations when you find a quote, passage, or section in the text you want to quickly return to for future reference. In addition, their size affords you the space to write more extensive notes than if you were to simply write in the margins, but doesn’t take up so much space that half the page is covered and not visible.

### Create a Color Coded System 

Another upside of these post-it page markers is that they come in an assortment of colors which lends itself well to creating a color coded system. Having such a system helps organize your markers so that you can more easily find certain passages without going through the hassle of flipping through all your markers. It also helps give you a guide of what to look for and mark up. Here is a suggested color coding system you can assign to each marker:

- Pink: favorite quotes
- Orange: think more about, disagree, unsure
- Yellow: key ideas, themes
- Green: major plot point 
- Blue: funny or memorable moment

## Annotating is for Yourself

Especially for those with more perfectionistic tendencies, it can feel unnerving not having a standard for “good” annotating. But it helps to remember that no one is going to judge your annotations since they are not for anyone but yourself. What you choose to highlight, comment on, or mark up depends on what you want to remember and what feels important to you. 

So don’t take your annotations too seriously. At the end of the day, annotating is just another way of enriching your reading experience by keeping you engaged and helping you remember.
